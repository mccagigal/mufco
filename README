MUFCO simulator is a multifrequency coupled oscillators simulator.
It is design to analyzed different coupling effects in a group
of oscillators with external perturbations. Oscillators 
can operate with different nominal frequencies, spread over a 
discrete number of frequency components.

Downloading MUFCO
-----------------

The source code of mufco simulator can be downloaded
through git:

$ git clone https://github.com/mccagigal/mufco.git

Compiling MUFCO
---------------

The MUFCO simulator can be compiled using the compilation 
script in the main folder:

$ ./build_simulator.sh 

Running MUFCO
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The MUFCO experiments are executed:

$ ./mufcoSim -p cnf/<CONFIGURATION_FILE>

The <CONFIGURATION_FILE> is an xml file which defines the experiment to be executed.

Configuring MUFCO
-----------------

The configuration of the MUFCO simulator is divided in five sections:

* Simulation: experiment general parameters.
- seed: define the seed of the random number generator.
	[0-N] int value of the seed.
	-1    the seed is taken from the CPU clock.
- length: experiment time in time steps.
	  [1-N] int value.
- sampling: sampling period of signals.
	    [1-N] int value.
-fft_lng : FFT windows length.
	   [2-N] int value 2-power.

* Environment: environment parameters.

* Oscillators: oscillator parameters.

* Visualization: visualization parameters.

* Writer: writer parameters.
